### Challenge - 3 : *ALGORITHMS* 

<br>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
#### **_Problem Description_** : 
<br>
Sorting Algorithms play an important role in recommendation engines. By the end of the project, the following questions should be answered :
- What role is played by sorting algorithms in recommendation engine.
- Which sorting algorithm is used in this project and why?

In this project, i have implemented Recommendation Engine for Movies.


<br><br>
<!-- APPROACH : WHAT AND WHY -->
#### **_Answering the questions_** :
<br>

> Different approaches, choosing an approach and why.
To understand the role of sorting algorithms and make a choice, one should know the different types of filtering algorithms present. They are:
1. Content-based filtering - In this, content is recommended to a user based on the past content-interaction of the same user.
2. Collaborative filtering - In this, content is recommended to a user based on the similarity of that user's content-interaction to another user's content-interaction. Users with similar activities are recommeded similar contents.
3. Hybrid filtering - This is a combination of Content-based and Collaborative filtering.

My objective was to implement an approach that would be :
- relevant to the user (content similarity)
- avoid cold start to the problem
Therefore, content-based filtering approach has been used in this project.

<!-- PROJECT PLANNING AND TRAJECTORY -->
#### _Selecting the dataset_ :
<br>

> Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/discussion?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv
> The datasets are also available with this repo, in a folder titled *api_utils*

The following were the factors kept in mind while selecting the dataset :
- Relevant and useful data
- Different and diverse attributes (to facilitate content-based filtering approach)
- Manageable computational load


#### _Project Flow_ :
1. Dataset Analysis
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Model Building (using text vectorization and cosine similarity)
4. Model Testing
5. Establishing web connection (using Reactjs and Flask Api)

## Prerequisites

You must have the following installed:

- [Node.js v12+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [python v3.10.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  
## Build Instructions

Running the Web App on your Local System
-----------------------------------------

To run the web app in your local device, run the following commands in your terminal:-

Clone the GitHub repository into your local device by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AssimUjjwal/Recommendation-Engine-Engage22
cd Recommendation-Engine-Engage22
```
In the project directory:
  You need to switch on two terminals.
  
Terminal 1:
```bash
cd 'FrontEnd- React'
npm install
npm start
```
  
Terminal 2:
```bash
cd 'BackEnd- Flask'
python -m venv venv
venv/scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
  
Then you are good to go!!
